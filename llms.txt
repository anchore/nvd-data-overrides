# NVD Data Overrides

This repository contains additional vulnerability data to fill gaps in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). It provides CPE configurations and other vulnerability information not currently available in NVD.

## Repository Structure

- `data/` - JSON files organized by year containing CVE override data
- `schema/` - JSON schema definition for override data format
- `scripts/` - Generation and maintenance scripts

## Data Format

Each JSON file contains:
- CVE ID and metadata
- CPE match configurations
- Version ranges for affected software
- Vulnerability status information

## Purpose

This is a generated data repository that supplements NVD's public vulnerability dataset. It does not provide severity scores (only NVD can provide official NVD CVSS scores) but focuses on missing configuration data.

The tooling and collaboration happens in the [vulnerability-data-tools](https://github.com/anchore/vulnerability-data-tools) repository.
