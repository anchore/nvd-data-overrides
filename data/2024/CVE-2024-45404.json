    "description": "OpenCTI is an open-source cyber threat intelligence platform. In versions below 6.2.18, because the function to limit the rate of OTP does not exist, an attacker with valid credentials or a malicious user who commits internal fraud can break through the two-factor authentication and hijack the account. This is because the otpLogin mutation does not implement One Time Password rate limiting. As of time of publication, it is unknown whether a patch is available.",
