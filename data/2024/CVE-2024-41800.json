    "description": "Craft is a content management system (CMS). Craft CMS 5 allows reuse of TOTP tokens multiple times within the validity period. An attacker is able to re-submit a valid TOTP token to establish an authenticated session. This requires that the attacker has knowledge of the victim's credentials. This has been patched in Craft 5.2.3.",
