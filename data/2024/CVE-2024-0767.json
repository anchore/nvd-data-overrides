    "description": "The Envo's Elementor Templates & Widgets for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.4.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ajax_plugin_activation function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to activate arbitrary installed plugins via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
