This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to perform actions on files outside of the originally intended directory and enables file uploads to directories outside of the web root. Depending on server configuration it may be possible to upload files with double extensions. This vulnerability only affects Windows.",
