    "description": "NuGet Gallery is a package repository that powers nuget.org. The NuGetGallery has a security vulnerability related to its handling of autolinks in Markdown content. While the platform properly filters out JavaScript from standard links, it does not adequately sanitize autolinks. This oversight allows attackers to exploit autolinks as a vector for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This vulnerability is fixed in 2024.12.06.",
