    "description": "GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. A stack-buffer overflow has been detected in the vorbis_handle_identification_packet function within gstvorbisdec.c. The position array is a stack-allocated buffer of size 64. If vd->vi.channels exceeds 64, the for loop will write beyond the boundaries of the position array. The value written will always be GST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_NONE. This vulnerability allows to overwrite the EIP address allocated in the stack. Additionally, this bug can overwrite the GstAudioInfo info structure. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.",
