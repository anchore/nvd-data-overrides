    "description": "ImageSharp is a 2D graphics API. A data leakage flaw was found in ImageSharp's JPEG and TGA decoders. This vulnerability is triggered when an attacker passes a specially crafted JPEG or TGA image file to a software using ImageSharp, potentially disclosing sensitive information from other parts of the software in the resulting image buffer. The problem has been patched in v3.1.4 and v2.1.8.",
