    "description": "GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An OOB-read vulnerability has been identified in the gst_avi_subtitle_parse_gab2_chunk function within gstavisubtitle.c. The function reads the name_length value directly from the input file without checking it properly. Then, the a condition, does not properly handle cases where name_length is greater than 0xFFFFFFFF - 17, causing an integer overflow. In such scenario, the function attempts to access memory beyond the buffer leading to an OOB-read. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.",
