    "description": "LibreNMS is an open-source, PHP/MySQL/SNMP-based network monitoring system. A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the \"Port Settings\" page allows authenticated users to inject arbitrary JavaScript through the \"name\" parameter when creating a new Port Group. This vulnerability results in the execution of malicious code when the \"Port Settings\" page is visited after the affected Port Group is added to a device, potentially compromising user sessions and allowing unauthorized actions. This vulnerability is fixed in 24.10.0.",
