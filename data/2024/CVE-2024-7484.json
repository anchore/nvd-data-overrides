    "description": "The CRM Perks Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient file validation on the 'handle_uploaded_files' function in versions up to, and including, 1.1.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrator-level capabilities or above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.",
