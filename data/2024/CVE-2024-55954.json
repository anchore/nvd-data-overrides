    "description": "OpenObserve is a cloud-native observability platform. A vulnerability in the user management endpoint `/api/{org_id}/users/{email_id}` allows an \"Admin\" role user to remove a \"Root\" user from the organization. This violates the intended privilege hierarchy, enabling a non-root user to remove the highest-privileged account. Due to insufficient role checks, the `remove_user_from_org` function does not prevent an \"Admin\" user from removing a \"Root\" user. As a result, an attacker with an \"Admin\" role can remove critical \"Root\" users, potentially gaining effective full control by eliminating the highest-privileged accounts. The `DELETE /api/{org_id}/users/{email_id}` endpoint is affected. This issue has been addressed in release version `0.14.1` and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
