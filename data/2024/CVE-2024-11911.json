    "description": "The WP Crowdfunding plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized plugin installation due to a missing capability check on the install_woocommerce_plugin() function action in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.12. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to install WooCommerce. This has a limited impact on most sites because WooCommerce is a requirement.",
