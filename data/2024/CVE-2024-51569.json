    "description": "Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability in Apache NimBLE.\n\nMissing proper validation of HCI Number Of Completed Packets could lead to out-of-bound access when parsing HCI event and invalid read from HCI transport memory.\nThis issue requires broken or bogus Bluetooth controller and thus severity is considered low.\nThis issue affects Apache NimBLE: through 1.7.0.\n\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 1.8.0, which fixes the issue.",
