    "description": "The Apptivo Business Site CRM plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 5.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'awp_ip_deny' page. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to block IP addresses via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
