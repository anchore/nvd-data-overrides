    "description": "Nagios XI < 2024R1.3.2 contains a remote code execution vulnerability by chaining two flaws: an arbitrary file upload and a path traversal in the Core Config Snapshots interface. The issue arises from insufficient validation of file paths and extensions during MIB upload and snapshot rename operations. Exploitation results in the placement of attacker-controlled PHP files in a web-accessible directory, executed as the www-data user.",
