    "description": "The Advanced Order Export For WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 3.5.5 via deserialization of untrusted input during Order export when the \"Try to convert serialized values\" option is enabled. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. The additional presence of a POP chain allows attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).",
