    "description": "LF Edge eKuiper is an internet-of-things data analytics and stream processing engine. Prior to version 2.0.8, auser with rights to modify the service (e.g. kuiperUser role) can inject a cross-site scripting payload into the rule `id` parameter. Then, after any user with access to this service (e.g. admin) tries make any modifications with the rule (update, run, stop, delete), a payload acts in the victim's browser. Version 2.0.8 fixes the issue.",
