    "description": "The Contact Form by Supsystic plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.29. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a saveAsCopy function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
