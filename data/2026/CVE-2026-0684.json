    "description": "The CP Image Store with Slideshow plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.9 due to a logic error in the 'cpis_admin_init' function's permission check. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to import arbitrary products via XML, if the XML file has already been uploaded to the server.",
