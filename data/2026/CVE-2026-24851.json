The vulnerability requires a model that has a a relation directly assignable by a type bound public access and assignable by type bound non-public access, a tuple assigned for the relation that is a type bound public access, a tuple assigned for the same object with the same relation that is not type bound public access, and a tuple assigned for a different object that has an object ID lexicographically larger with the same user and relation which is not type bound public access.
