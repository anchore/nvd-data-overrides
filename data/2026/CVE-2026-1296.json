    "description": "The Frontend Post Submission Manager Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Open Redirection in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.7 due to insufficient validation on the 'requested_page' POST parameter in the verify_username_password function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to redirect users to potentially malicious sites if they can successfully trick them into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
