    "description": "The WP-DownloadManager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Path Traversal in all versions up to, and including, 1.69 via the 'download_path' configuration parameter. This is due to insufficient validation of the download path setting, which allows directory traversal sequences to bypass the WP_CONTENT_DIR prefix check. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to configure the plugin to list and access arbitrary files on the server by exploiting the file browser functionality.",
