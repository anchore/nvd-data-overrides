    "description": "Kanboard is project management software focused on Kanban methodology. Versions 1.2.48 and below are vulnerable to an Open Redirect attack that allows malicious actors to redirect authenticated users to attacker-controlled websites. By crafting URLs such as //evil.com, attackers can bypass the filter_var($url, FILTER_VALIDATE_URL) validation check. This vulnerability could be exploited to conduct phishing attacks, steal user credentials, or distribute malware. The issue is fixed in version 1.2.49.",
