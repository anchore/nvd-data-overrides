    "description": "pwn.college DOJO is an education platform for learning cybersecurity. Prior to commit e33da14449a5abcff507e554f66e2141d6683b0a, missing sandboxing on `/workspace/*` routes allows challenge authors to inject arbitrary javascript which runs on the same origin as `http[:]//dojo[.]website`. This is a sandbox escape leading to arbitrary javascript execution as the dojo's origin. A challenge author can craft a page that executes any dangerous actions that the user could. Version e33da14449a5abcff507e554f66e2141d6683b0a patches the issue.",
