    "description": "jsPDF is a library to generate PDFs in JavaScript. Prior to 4.2.0, user control of properties and methods of the Acroform module allows users to inject arbitrary PDF objects, such as JavaScript actions. If given the possibility to pass unsanitized input to one of the following property, a user can inject arbitrary PDF objects, such as JavaScript actions, which are executed when the victim hovers over the radio option. The vulnerability has been fixed in jsPDF@4.2.0. As a workaround, sanitize user input before passing it to the vulnerable API members.",
