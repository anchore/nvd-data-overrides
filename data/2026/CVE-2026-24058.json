    "description": "Soft Serve is a self-hostable Git server for the command line. Versions 0.11.2 and below have a critical authentication bypass vulnerability that allows an attacker to impersonate any user (including admin) by \"offering\" the victim's public key during the SSH handshake before authenticating with their own valid key. This occurs because the user identity is stored in the session context during the \"offer\" phase and is not cleared if that specific authentication attempt fails. This issue has been fixed in version 0.11.3.",
