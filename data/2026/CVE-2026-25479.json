    "description": "Litestar is an Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI) framework. Prior to 2.20.0, in litestar.middleware.allowed_hosts, allowlist entries are compiled into regex patterns in a way that allows regex metacharacters to retain special meaning (e.g., . matches any character). This enables a bypass where an attacker supplies a host that matches the regex but is not the intended literal hostname. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.20.0.",
