    "description": "n8n is an open source workflow automation platform. Prior to 1.121.0, there is a vulnerability in the HTTP Request node's credential domain validation allowed an authenticated attacker to send requests with credentials to unintended domains, potentially leading to credential exfiltration. This only might affect user who have credentials that use wildcard domain patterns (e.g., *.example.com) in the \"Allowed domains\" setting. This issue is fixed in version 1.121.0 and later.",
