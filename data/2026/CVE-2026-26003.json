    "description": "FastGPT is an AI Agent building platform. From 4.14.0 to 4.14.5, attackers can directly access the plugin system through FastGPT/api/plugin/xxx without authentication, thereby threatening the plugin system. This may cause the plugin system to crash and the loss of plugin installation status, but it will not result in key leakage. For older versions, as there are only operation interfaces for obtaining information, the impact is almost negligible. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.14.5-fix.",
