    "description": "Swiper is a free and mobile touch slider with hardware accelerated transitions and native behavior. Versions 6.5.1 through 12.1.1 have a Prototype pollution vulnerability. The vulnerability resides in line 94 of shared/utils.mjs, where the indexOf() function is used to check whether user provided input contain forbidden strings. Despite a previous fix that attempted to mitigate prototype pollution by checking whether user input contained a forbidden key, it is still possible to pollute Object.prototype via a crafted input using Array.prototype. The exploit works across Windows and Linux and on Node and Bun runtimes.  Any application that processes attacker-controlled input using this package may be affected  by the following: Authentication Bypass, Denial of Service and RCE. This issue is fixed in version 12.1.2.",
