    "description": "The Frontend File Manager Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized file sharing due to a missing capability check on the 'wpfm_send_file_in_email' AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 23.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to share arbitrary uploaded files via email by supplying a file ID. Since file IDs are sequential integers, attackers can enumerate all uploaded files on the site and exfiltrate sensitive data that was intended to be restricted to administrators only.",
