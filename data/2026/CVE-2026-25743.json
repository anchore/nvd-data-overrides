    "description": "OpenEMR is a free and open source electronic health records and medical practice management application. Prior to version 8.0.0, users with the \"Forms administration\" role can fill questionnaires (\"forms\") in patient encounters. The answers to the forms are displayed on the encounter page and in the visit history for the users with the same role. There exists a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the function to display the form answers, allowing any authenticated attacker with the specific role to insert arbitrary JavaScript into the system by entering malicious payloads to the form answers. The JavaScript code is later executed by any user with the form role when viewing the form answers in the patient encounter pages or visit history. Version 8.0.0 fixes the issue.",
