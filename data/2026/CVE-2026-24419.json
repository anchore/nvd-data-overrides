OpenSTAManager v2.9.8 and earlier contain a critical Error-Based SQL Injection vulnerability in the Prima Nota (Journal Entry) module's add.php file. The application fails to validate that comma-separated values from the id_documenti GET parameter are integers before using them in SQL IN() clauses, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL commands and extract sensitive data through XPATH error messages.",
