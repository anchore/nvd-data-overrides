    "description": "RustFS is a distributed object storage system built in Rust. Prior to version alpha.78, IP-based access control can be bypassed: get_condition_values trusts client-supplied X-Forwarded-For/X-Real-Ip without verifying a trusted proxy, so any reachable client can spoof aws:SourceIp and satisfy IP-allowlist policies. This issue has been patched in version alpha.78.",
