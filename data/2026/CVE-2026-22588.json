    "description": "Spree is an open source e-commerce solution built with Ruby on Rails. Prior to versions 4.10.2, 5.0.7, 5.1.9, and 5.2.5, an Authenticated Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was identified that allows an authenticated user to retrieve other users’ address information by modifying an existing order. By editing an order they legitimately own and manipulating address identifiers in the request, the backend server accepts and processes references to addresses belonging to other users, subsequently associating those addresses with the attacker’s order and returning them in the response. This issue has been patched in versions 4.10.2, 5.0.7, 5.1.9, and 5.2.5.",
