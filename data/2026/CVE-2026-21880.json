    "description": "Kanboard is project management software focused on Kanban methodology. Versions 1.2.48 and below have an LDAP Injection vulnerability in the LDAP authentication mechanism. User-supplied input is directly substituted into LDAP search filters without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to enumerate all LDAP users, discover sensitive user attributes, and perform targeted attacks against specific accounts. This issue is fixed in version 1.2.49.",
