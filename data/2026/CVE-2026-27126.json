    "description": "Craft is a content management system (CMS). In versions 4.5.0-RC1 through 4.16.18 and 5.0.0-RC1 through 5.8.22, a stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the `editableTable.twig` component when using the `html` column type. The application fails to sanitize the input, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript when another user views a page with the malicious table field. In order to exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must have an administrator account, and `allowAdminChanges` must be enabled in production, which is against Craft's security recommendations. Versions 4.16.19 and 5.8.23 patch the issue.",
