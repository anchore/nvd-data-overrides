    "description": "WeKnora is an LLM-powered framework designed for deep document understanding and semantic retrieval. Prior to version 0.2.5, there is a command injection vulnerability that allows authenticated users to inject stdio_config.command/args into MCP stdio settings, causing the server to execute subprocesses using these injected values.
