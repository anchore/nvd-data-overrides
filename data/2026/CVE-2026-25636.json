    "description": "calibre is an e-book manager. In 9.1.0 and earlier, a path traversal vulnerability in Calibre's EPUB conversion allows a malicious EPUB file to corrupt arbitrary existing files writable by the Calibre process. During conversion, Calibre resolves CipherReference URI from META-INF/encryption.xml to an absolute filesystem path and opens it in read-write mode, even when it points outside the conversion extraction directory. This vulnerability is fixed in 9.2.0.",
