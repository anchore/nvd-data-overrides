    "description": "Signal K Server is a server application that runs on a central hub in a boat. Prior to 1.5.0, a command injection vulnerability allows authenticated users with write permissions to execute arbitrary shell commands on the Signal K server when the set-system-time plugin is enabled. Unauthenticated users can also exploit this vulnerability if security is disabled on the Signal K server. This occurs due to unsafe construction of shell commands when processing navigation.datetime values received via WebSocket delta messages. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.5.0.",
