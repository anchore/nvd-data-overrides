    "description": "CoreShop is a Pimcore enhanced eCommerce solution. An error-based SQL Injection vulnerability was identified in versions prior to 4.1.9 in the `CustomerTransformerController` within the CoreShop admin panel. The affected endpoint improperly interpolates user-supplied input into a SQL query, leading to database error disclosure and potential data extraction. Version 4.1.9 fixes the issue.",
