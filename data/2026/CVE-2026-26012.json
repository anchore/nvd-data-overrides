    "description": "vaultwarden is an unofficial Bitwarden compatible server written in Rust, formerly known as bitwarden_rs. Prior to 1.35.3, a regular organization member can retrieve all ciphers within an organization, regardless of collection permissions. The endpoint /ciphers/organization-details is accessible to any organization member and internally uses Cipher::find_by_org to retrieve all ciphers. These ciphers are returned with CipherSyncType::Organization without enforcing collection-level access control. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.35.3.",
