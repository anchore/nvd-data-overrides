    "description": "Cross-Realm Token Acceptance Bypass in KeycloakSecurityPolicy Apache Camel Keycloak component. \n\nThe Camel-Keycloak KeycloakSecurityPolicy does not validate the iss (issuer) claim of JWT tokens against the configured realm. A token issued by one Keycloak realm is silently accepted by a policy configured for a completely different realm, breaking tenant isolation.\nThis issue affects Apache Camel: from 4.15.0 before 4.18.0.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 4.18.0, which fixes the issue.",
