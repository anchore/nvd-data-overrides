    "description": "Hono is a Web application framework that provides support for any JavaScript runtime. Prior to version 4.11.7, Cache Middleware contains an information disclosure vulnerability caused by improper handling of HTTP cache control directives. The middleware does not respect standard cache control headers such as `Cache-Control: private` or `Cache-Control: no-store`, which may result in private or authenticated responses being cached and subsequently exposed to unauthorized users. Version 4.11.7 has a patch for the issue.",
