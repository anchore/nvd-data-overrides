    "description": "Dokploy is a free, self-hostable Platform as a Service (PaaS). In versions prior to 0.26.6, the Dokploy web interface is vulnerable to Clickjacking attacks due to missing frame-busting headers. This allows attackers to embed Dokploy pages in malicious iframes and trick authenticated users into performing unintended actions. Version 0.26.6 patches the issue.",
