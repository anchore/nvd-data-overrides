    "description": "Apache Superset utilizes a configurable dictionary, DISALLOWED_SQL_FUNCTIONS, to restrict the execution of potentially sensitive SQL functions within SQL Lab and charts. While this feature included restrictions for engines like PostgreSQL, a vulnerability was reported where the default list for the ClickHouse engine was incomplete.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Superset: before 4.1.2.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 4.1.2, which fixes the issue.",
