    "description": "The Church Admin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 5.0.28 due to insufficient validation of user-supplied URLs in the 'audio_url' parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access, to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web application and can be used to query and modify information from internal services.",
