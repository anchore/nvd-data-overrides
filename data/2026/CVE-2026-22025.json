    "description": "CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. Prior to version 1.4.3, when the KMC server returns a non-200 HTTP status code, cryptography_encrypt() and cryptography_decrypt() return immediately without freeing previously allocated buffers. Each failed request leaks approximately 467 bytes. Repeated failures (from a malicious server or network issues) can gradually exhaust memory. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.3.",
