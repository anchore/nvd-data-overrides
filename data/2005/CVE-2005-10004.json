    "description": "Cacti versions prior to 0.8.6-d contain a remote command execution vulnerability in the graph_view.php script. An authenticated user can inject arbitrary shell commands via the graph_start GET parameter, which is improperly handled during graph rendering. This flaw allows attackers to execute commands on the underlying operating system with the privileges of the web server process, potentially compromising system integrity.",
