    "description": "The Qyrr â€“ simply and modern QR-Code creation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the blob_to_file() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.",
