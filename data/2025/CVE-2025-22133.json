    "description": "WeGIA is a web manager for charitable institutions. Prior to 3.2.8, a critical vulnerability was identified in the /WeGIA/html/socio/sistema/controller/controla_xlsx.php endpoint. The endpoint accepts file uploads without proper validation, allowing the upload of malicious files, such as .phar, which can then be executed by the server. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.2.8.",
