    "description": "Sensitive data exposure via logging in basic-auth leads to plaintext usernames and passwords written to error logs and forwarded to log sinks when log level is INFO/DEBUG. This creates a high risk of credential compromise through log access.\nIt has been fixed in the following commit:  https://github.com/apache/apisix/pull/12629 \nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 3.14, which fixes this issue.",
