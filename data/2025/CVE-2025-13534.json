    "description": "The ELEX WordPress HelpDesk & Customer Ticketing System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.2. This is due to missing authorization checks on the eh_crm_edit_agent AJAX action. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to escalate their WSDesk privileges from limited \"Reply Tickets\" permissions to full helpdesk administrator capabilities, gaining unauthorized access to ticket management, settings configuration, agent administration, and sensitive customer data.",
