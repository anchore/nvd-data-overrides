    "description": "The AdForest theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 6.0.9. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying a user's identity prior to authenticating them. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as other users, including administrators, without access to a password.",
