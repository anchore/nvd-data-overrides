    "description": "Homarr is an open-source dashboard. Prior to version 1.43.3, stored XSS vulnerability exists, allowing the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in a user's browser, with minimal or no user interaction required, due to the rendering of a malicious uploaded SVG file. This could be abused to add an attacker's account to the \"credentials-admin\" group, giving them full administrative access, if a user logged in as an administrator was to view the page which renders or redirects to the SVG. This issue has been patched in version 1.43.3.",
