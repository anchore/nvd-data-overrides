    "description": "Craft is a platform for creating digital experiences. In versions 5.0.0-RC1 through 5.8.20 and 4.0.0-RC1 through 4.16.16, authenticated users on a Craft installation could potentially expose sensitive assets via their user profile photo via maliciously crafted requests. Users should update to the patched versions (5.8.21 and 4.16.17) to mitigate the issue.",
