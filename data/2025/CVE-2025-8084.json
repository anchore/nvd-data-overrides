    "description": "The AI Engine plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.8 via the rest_helpers_create_images function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Editor-level access and above, to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web application and can be used to query and modify information from internal services. On Cloud instances, this issue allows for metadata retrieving.",
