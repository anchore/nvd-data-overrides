    "description": "AIOHTTP is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. Versions 3.13.2 and below contain parser logic which allows non-ASCII decimals to be present in the Range header. There is no known impact, but there is the possibility that there's a method to exploit a request smuggling vulnerability. This issue is fixed in version 3.13.3.",
