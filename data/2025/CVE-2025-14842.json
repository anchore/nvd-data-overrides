    "description": "The Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload – Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to limited upload of files with a dangerous type in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.9.2. This is due to the plugin not blocking .phar and .svg files. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary .phar or .svg files containing malicious PHP or JavaScript code. Malicious PHP code can be used to achieve remote code execution on the server via direct file access, if the server is configured to execute .phar files as PHP. The upload of .svg files allows for Stored Cross-Site Scripting under certain circumstances.",
