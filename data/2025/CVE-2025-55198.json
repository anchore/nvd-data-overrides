    "description": "Helm is a package manager for Charts for Kubernetes. Prior to version 3.18.5, when parsing Chart.yaml and index.yaml files, an improper validation of type error can lead to a panic. This issue has been resolved in Helm 3.18.5. A workaround involves ensuring YAML files are formatted as Helm expects prior to processing them with Helm.",
