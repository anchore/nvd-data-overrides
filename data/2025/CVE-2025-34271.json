    "description": "Nagios Log Server versions prior toÂ 2024R2.0.2 contain a vulnerability in the cluster manager component when requesting sensitive credentials from peer nodes over an unencrypted channel even when SSL/TLS is enabled in the product configuration. As a result, an attacker positioned on the network path can intercept credentials in transit. Captured credentials could allow the attacker to authenticate as a cluster node or service account, enabling further unauthorized access, lateral movement, or system compromise.",
