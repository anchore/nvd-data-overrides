    "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists where a malicious Raft node can exploit insecure Hessian deserialization within the PD store. The fix enforces IP-based authentication to restrict cluster membership and implements a strict class whitelist to harden the Hessian serialization process against object injection attacks.\n\n\n\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 1.7.0, which fixes the issue.",
