    "description": "FreshRSS is a free, self-hostable RSS aggregator. Prior to version 1.28.0, FreshRSS uses cryptographically weak random number generators (mt_rand() and uniqid()) to generate remember-me authentication tokens and challenge-response nonces. This allows attackers to predict valid session tokens, leading to account takeover through persistent session hijacking. The remember-me tokens provide permanent authentication and are the sole credential for \"keep me logged in\" functionality. This issue has been patched in version 1.28.0.",
