    "description": "The ELEX WordPress HelpDesk & Customer Ticketing System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.5. This is due to missing capability checks on the eh_crm_ticket_general function combined with a shared nonce that is exposed to low-privileged users. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to modify global WSDesk settings via the `eh_crm_ticket_general` AJAX action.",
