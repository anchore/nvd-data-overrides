    "description": "Knowage is an open source analytics and business intelligence suite. Prior to version 8.1.37, there is a blind server-side request forgery vulnerability. The vulnerability allows attackers to send requests to arbitrary hosts/paths. Since the attacker is not able to read the response, the impact of this vulnerability is limited. However, an attacker should be able to leverage this vulnerability to scan the internal network. This issue has been patched in version 8.1.37.",
