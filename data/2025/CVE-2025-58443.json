    "description": "FOG is a free open-source cloning/imaging/rescue suite/inventory management system. Versions 1.5.10.1673 and below contain an authentication bypass vulnerability. It is possible for an attacker to perform an unauthenticated DB dump where they could pull a full SQL DB without credentials. A fix is expected to be released 9/15/2025. To address this vulnerability immediately, upgrade to the latest version of either the dev-branch or working-1.6 branch. This will patch the issue for users concerned about immediate exposure. See the FOG Project documentation for step-by-step upgrade instructions: https://docs.fogproject.org/en/latest/install-fog-server#choosing-a-fog-version.",
