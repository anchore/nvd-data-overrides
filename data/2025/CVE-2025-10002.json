    "description": "The ClickWhale â€“ Link Manager, Link Shortener and Click Tracker for Affiliate Links & Link Pages plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the export_csv() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.0 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. This may be exploitable by lower level users if access to the plugin is granted.",
