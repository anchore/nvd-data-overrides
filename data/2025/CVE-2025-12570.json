    "description": "The Fancy Product Designer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the data-to-image.php and pdf-to-image.php files. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file.",
