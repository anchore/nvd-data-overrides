    "description": "The Embed Any Document – Embed PDF, Word, PowerPoint and Excel Files plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the sanitize_pdf_src function regex bypass in all versions up to, and including, 2.7.10 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
