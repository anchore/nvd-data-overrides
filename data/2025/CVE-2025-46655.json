    "description": "CodiMD through 2.5.4 has a CSP-based protection mechanism against XSS through uploaded SVG documents containing JavaScript, but it can be bypassed in certain cases of different-origin file storage, such as AWS S3. NOTE: it can be considered a user error if AWS is employed for hosting untrusted JavaScript content, but the selected architecture within AWS does not have components that are able to insert Content-Security-Policy headers.",
