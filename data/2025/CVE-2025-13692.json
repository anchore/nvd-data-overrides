    "description": "The Unlimited Elements For Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 2.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file. A form with a file upload field must be created with the premium version of the plugin in order to exploit the vulnerability. However, once the form exists, the vulnerability is exploitable even if the premium version is deactivated and/or uninstalled.",
