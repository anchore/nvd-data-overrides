    "description": "The Newscrunch theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to a missing capability check in the newscrunch_install_and_activate_plugin() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.4.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.",
