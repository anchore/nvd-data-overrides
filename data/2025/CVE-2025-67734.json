    "description": "Frappe Learning Management System (LMS) is a learning system that helps users structure their content. Versions prior to 2.42.0 allowed authenticated attackers to enter JavaScript through the Company Website field of the Job Form, exposing users to an XSS attack. The script could then be executed in the browsers of users who opened the malicious job posting. This issue is fixed in version 2.42.0.",
