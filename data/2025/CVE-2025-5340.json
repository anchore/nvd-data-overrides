    "description": "The Music Player for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘album_buy_url’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
