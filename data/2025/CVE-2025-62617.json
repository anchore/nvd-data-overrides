    "description": "Admidio is an open-source user management solution. Prior to version 4.3.17, an authenticated SQL injection vulnerability exists in the member assignment data retrieval functionality of Admidio. Any authenticated user with permissions to assign members to a role (such as an administrator) can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL commands. This can lead to a full compromise of the application's database, including reading, modifying, or deleting all data. This issue has been patched in version 4.3.17.",
