    "description": "WeGIA is an open source web manager with a focus on the Portuguese language and charitable institutions. A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the `adicionar_cor.php` endpoint of the WeGIA application prior to version 3.4.5. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the `cor` parameter. The injected scripts are stored on the server and executed automatically whenever the affected page `cadastro_pet.php` is accessed by users, posing a significant security risk. Version 3.4.5 fixes the issue.",
