    "description": "New API is a large language mode (LLM) gateway and artificial intelligence (AI) asset management system. Prior to version 0.9.6, a recently patched SSRF vulnerability contains a bypass method that can bypass the existing security fix and still allow SSRF to occur.\nBecause the existing fix only applies security restrictions to the first URL request, a 302 redirect can bypass existing security measures and successfully access the intranet. This issue has been patched in version 0.9.6.",
