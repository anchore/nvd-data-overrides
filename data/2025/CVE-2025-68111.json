    "description": "ChurchCRM is an open-source church management system. In versions prior to 6.5.3, a SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `eGive.php` file within the \"ReImport\" functionality. An authenticated user with finance privileges can execute arbitrary SQL queries by manipulating the `MissingEgive_FamID_...` POST parameter. This can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion within the database. Version 6.5.3 has a patch for the issue.",
