    "description": "The Advanced Ads – Ad Manager & AdSense plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in versions up to, and including, 2.0.14. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized to perform an action in the `placement_update_item()` function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to update ad placements, allowing them to change which ad or ad group a placement serves.",
