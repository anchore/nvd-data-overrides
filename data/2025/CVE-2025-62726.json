    "description": "n8n is an open source workflow automation platform. Prior to 1.113.0, a remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Git Node component available in both Cloud and Self-Hosted versions of n8n. When a malicious actor clones a remote repository containing a pre-commit hook, the subsequent use of the Commit operation in the Git Node can inadvertently trigger the hookâ€™s execution. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary code within the n8n environment, potentially compromising the system and any connected credentials or workflows. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.113.0.",
