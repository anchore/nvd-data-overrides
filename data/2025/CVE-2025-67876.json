    "description": "ChurchCRM is an open-source church management system. A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in ChurchCRM versions 6.4.0 and prior that allows a low-privilege user with the “Manage Groups” permission to inject persistent JavaScript into group role names. The payload is saved in the database and executed whenever any user (including administrators) views a page that displays that role, such as GroupView.php or PersonView.php. This allows full session hijacking and account takeover. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available.",
