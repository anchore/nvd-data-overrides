    "description": "Versions of the package snyk before 1.1297.3 are vulnerable to Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File through local Snyk CLI debug logs. Container Registry credentials provided via environment variables or command line arguments can be exposed when executing Snyk CLI in DEBUG or DEBUG/TRACE mode.\n\nThe issue affects the following Snyk commands:\n\n1. When snyk container test or snyk container monitor commands are run against a container registry, with debug mode enabled, the container registry credentials may be written into the local Snyk CLI debug log. This only happens with credentials specified in environment variables (SNYK_REGISTRY_USERNAME and SNYK_REGISTRY_PASSWORD), or in the CLI (--password/-p and  --username/-u).\n\n2. When snyk auth command is executed with debug mode enabled AND the log level is set to TRACE, the Snyk access / refresh credential tokens used to connect the CLI to Snyk may be written into the local CLI debug logs.\n\n3. When snyk iac test is executed with a Remote IAC Custom rules bundle, debug mode enabled, AND the log level is set to TRACE, the docker registry token may be written into the local CLI debug logs.",
