    "description": "The Fluent Forms – Customizable Contact Forms, Survey, Quiz, & Conversational Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization in all versions up to, and including, 6.1.7. This is due to missing capability checks on the `fluentform_ai_create_form` AJAX action. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to create arbitrary forms via the publicly exposed AI builder.",
