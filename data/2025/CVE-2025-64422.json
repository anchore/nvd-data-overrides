    "description": "Coolify is an open-source and self-hostable tool for managing servers, applications, and databases. In Coolify vstarting with version 4.0.0-beta.434, the /login endpoint advertises a rate limit of 5 requests but can be trivially bypassed by rotating the X-Forwarded-For header. This enables unlimited credential stuffing and brute-force attempts against user and admin accounts. As of time of publication, it is unclear if a patch is available.",
