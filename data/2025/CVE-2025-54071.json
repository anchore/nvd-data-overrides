In versions 4.0.0-beta.3 and below, an authenticated arbitrary file write vulnerability exists in the /api/saves endpoint. This can lead to Remote Code Execution on the system. The vulnerability permits arbitrary file write operations, allowing attackers to create or modify files at any filesystem location with user-supplied content. A user with viewer role or Scope.ASSETS_WRITE permission or above is required to pass authentication checks. The vulnerability is fixed in version 4.0.0-beta.4.",
