    "description": "The WpEvently plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via multiple parameters in all versions up to, and including, 4.4.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
