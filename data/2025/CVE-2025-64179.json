In versions 1.69.0 and below, missing authentication in the /api/v1/usage-report/summary endpoint allows anyone to retrieve aggregate API usage counts. While no sensitive data is disclosed, the endpoint may reveal information about service activity or uptime. This issue is fixed in version 1.71.0 . To workaround the vulnerability, use a load-balancer or application level firewall in order to block the request route /api/v1/usage-report/summary.",
