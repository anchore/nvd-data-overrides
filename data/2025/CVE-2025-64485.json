    "description": "CVAT is an open source interactive video and image annotation tool for computer vision. In versions 2.4.0 through 2.48.1, a malicious CVAT user with at least the User global role may create files in the root of the mounted file share, or overwrite existing files. If no file share is mounted, the user will be able to create files in the share directory of the import worker container, potentially filling up disk space. This issue is fixed in version 2.49.0.",
