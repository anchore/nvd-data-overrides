    "description": "Release of Invalid Pointer or Reference vulnerability was discovered in fs/inode/fs_inoderemove code of the Apache NuttX RTOS that allowed root filesystem inode removal leading to a debug assert trigger (that is disabled by default), NULL pointer dereference (handled differently depending on the target architecture), or in general, a Denial of Service.\n\nThis issue affects Apache NuttX RTOS: from 10.0.0 before 12.10.0.\n\nUsers of filesystem based services with write access that were exposed over the network (i.e. FTP) are affected and recommended to upgrade to version 12.10.0 that fixes the issue.",
