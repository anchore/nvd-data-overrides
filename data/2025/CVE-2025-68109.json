    "description": "ChurchCRM is an open-source church management system. In versions prior to 6.5.3, the Database Restore functionality does not validate the content or file extension of uploaded files. As a result, an attacker can upload a web shell file and subsequently upload a .htaccess file to enable direct access to it. Once accessed, the uploaded web shell allows remote code execution (RCE) on the server. Version 6.5.3 fixes the issue.",
