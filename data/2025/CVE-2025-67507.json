    "description": "Filament is a collection of full-stack components for accelerated Laravel development. Versions 4.0.0 through 4.3.0 contain a flaw in the handling of recovery codes for app-based multi-factor authentication, allowing the same recovery code to be reused indefinitely. This issue does not affect email-based MFA. It also only applies when recovery codes are enabled. This issue is fixed in version 4.3.1.",
