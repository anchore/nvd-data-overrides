    "description": "The WP JobHunt plugin for WordPress, used by the JobCareer theme, is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘cs_job_title’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 7.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Candidate-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
