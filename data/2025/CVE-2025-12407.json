    "description": "The Events Manager – Calendar, Bookings, Tickets, and more! plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 7.2.2.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'location_delete' action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete locations via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
