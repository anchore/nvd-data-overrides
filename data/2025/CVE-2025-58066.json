    "description": "nptd-rs is a tool for synchronizing your computer's clock, implementing the NTP and NTS protocols. In versions between 1.2.0 and 1.6.1 inclusive servers which allow non-NTS traffic are affected by a denial of service vulnerability, where an attacker can induce a message storm between two NTP servers running ntpd-rs. Client-only configurations are not affected. Affected users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.6.2 as soon as possible.",
