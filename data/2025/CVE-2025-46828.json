    "description": "WeGIA is a web manager for charitable institutions.  An unauthenticated SQL Injection vulnerability was identified in versions up to and including 3.3.0 in the endpoint `/html/socio/sistema/get_socios.php`, specifically in the query parameter. This issue allows attackers to inject and execute arbitrary SQL statements against the application's underlying database. As a result, it may lead to data exfiltration, authentication bypass, or complete database compromise. Version 3.3.1 fixes the issue.",
