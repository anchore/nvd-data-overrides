    "description": "The Betheme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘page_title’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 28.1.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of theme breadcrumbs. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
