    "description": "The Secure Copy Content Protection and Content Locking plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 4.9.2. This is due to missing nonce validation on the 'ays_sccp_results_export_file' AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to export sensitive plugin data including email addresses, IP addresses, physical addresses, user IDs, and other user information via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. The exported data is stored in a publicly accessible file, allowing attackers to receive the sensitive information even though they are not authenticated.",
