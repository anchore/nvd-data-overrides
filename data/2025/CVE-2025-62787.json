    "description": "Wazuh is a free and open source platform used for threat prevention, detection, and response. Prior to 4.10.2, a buffer over-read occurs in DecodeWinevt() when child_attr[p]->attributes[j] is accessed, because the corresponding index (j) is incorrect. A compromised agent can cause a READ operation beyond the end of the allocated buffer (which may contain sensitive information) by sending a specially crafted message to the wazuh manager. An attacker who is able to craft and send an agent message to the wazuh manager can cause a buffer over-read and potentially access sensitive data. While the buffer over-read is always triggered while resolving the arguments of mdebug2, specific configuration options (analysisd.debug=2) need to be in place for the respective data to be leaked. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.10.2.",
