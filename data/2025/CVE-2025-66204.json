    "description": "WBCE CMS is a content management system. Version 1.6.4 contains a brute-force protection bypass where an attacker can indefinitely reset the counter by modifying `X-Forwarded-For` on each request, gaining unlimited password guessing attempts, effectively bypassing all brute-force protection. The application fully trusts the `X-Forwarded-For` header without validating it or restricting its usage. This issue is fixed in version 1.6.5.",
