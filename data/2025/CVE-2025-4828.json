    "description": "The Support Board plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the sb_file_delete function in all versions up to, and including, 3.8.0. This makes it possible for attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php). An attacker can leverage CVE-2025-4855 vulnerability to exploit this vulnerability unauthenticated.",
