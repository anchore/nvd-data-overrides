    "description": "Knowage is an open source analytics and business intelligence suite. Prior to version 8.1.37, Knowage is vulnerable to server-side request forgery. The vulnerability allows attackers to send requests to arbitrary hosts/paths. Since the attacker is not able to read the response, the impact of this vulnerability is limited. However, an attacker could be able to leverage this vulnerability to scan the internal network. This issue has been patched in version 8.1.37.",
