    "description": "The WP Duplicate Page plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to missing capability checks on the 'duplicateBulkHandle' and 'duplicateBulkHandleHPOS' functions in all versions up to, and including, 1.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to duplicate arbitrary posts, pages, and WooCommerce HPOS orders even when their role is explicitly excluded from the plugin's \"Allowed User Roles\" setting, potentially exposing sensitive information and allowing duplicate fulfillment of WooCommerce orders.",
