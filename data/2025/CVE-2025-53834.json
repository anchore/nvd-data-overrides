    "description": "Caido is a web security auditing toolkit. A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in Caido’s toast UI component in versions prior to 0.49.0. Toast messages may reflect unsanitized user input in certain tools such as Match&Replace and Scope. This could allow an attacker to craft input that results in arbitrary script execution. Version 0.49.0 fixes the issue.",
