    "description": "ChurchCRM is an open-source church management system. In versions prior to 6.5.4, there is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the GroupEditor.php page of the application. When a user attempts to create a group role, they can execute malicious JavaScript. However, for this to work, the user must have permission to view and modify groups in the application.
