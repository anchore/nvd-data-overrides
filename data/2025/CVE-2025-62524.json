    "description": "PILOS (Platform for Interactive Live-Online Seminars) is a frontend for BigBlueButton. PILOS before 4.8.0 exposes the PHP version via the X-Powered-By header, enabling attackers to fingerprint the server and assess potential exploits. This information disclosure vulnerability originates from PHPâ€™s base image. Additionally, the PHP version can also be inferred through the PILOS version displayed in the footer and by examining the source code available on GitHub. This information disclosure vulnerability has been patched in PILOS in v4.8.0.",
