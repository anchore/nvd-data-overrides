    "description": "An authenticated malicious actor using specially crafted requests could bypass row level security configuration by injecting SQL into 'sqlExpression' fields. This allowed the execution of sub-queries to evade parsing defenses ultimately granting unauthorized access to data.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Superset: before 4.1.2.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 4.1.2, which fixes the issue.",
