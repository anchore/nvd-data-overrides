    "description": "Frappe Learning is a learning system that helps users structure their content. Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to version 2.41.0, when admins revoked a role from the user, the effect was not immediate because of caching. The issue has been fixed in version 2.41.0 by ensuring the cache is cleared after roles are updated.",
