    "description": "OpenID Connect Core through 1.0 errata set 2 allows audience injection in certain situations. When the private_key_jwt authentication mechanism is used, a malicious Authorization Server could trick a Client into writing attacker-controlled values into the audience, including token endpoints or issuer identifiers of other Authorization Servers. The malicious Authorization Server could then use these private key JWTs to impersonate the Client.",
