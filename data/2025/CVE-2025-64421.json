    "description": "Coolify is an open-source and self-hostable tool for managing servers, applications, and databases. In Coolify versions up to and including v4.0.0-beta.434, a low privileged user (member) can invite a high privileged user. At first, the application will throw an error, but if the attacker clicks the invite button a second time, it actually works. This way, a low privileged user can invite themselves as an administrator to the Coolify instance. After the high privileged user is invited, the attacker can initiate a password reset and log in with the new admin. As of time of publication, it is unclear if a patch is available.",
