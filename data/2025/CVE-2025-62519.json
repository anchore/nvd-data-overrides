    "description": "phpMyFAQ is an open source FAQ web application. Prior to version 4.0.14, an authenticated SQL injection vulnerability in the main configuration update functionality of phpMyFAQ allows a privileged user with 'Configuration Edit' permissions to execute arbitrary SQL commands. Successful exploitation can lead to a full compromise of the database, including reading, modifying, or deleting all data, as well as potential remote code execution depending on the database configuration.
