    "description": "Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. Versions 1.6.23 and below contain case-sensitive checks in the way Cursor IDE protects its sensitive files (e.g., */.cursor/mcp.json), which allows attackers to modify the content of these files through prompt injection and achieve remote code execution. A prompt injection can lead to full RCE through modifying sensitive files on case-insensitive fileystems. This issue is fixed in version 1.7.",
