    "description": "1Panel is an open-source, web-based control panel for Linux server management. Versions 2.0.13 and below allow an unauthenticated attacker to disable CAPTCHA verification by abusing a client-controlled parameter. Because the server previously trusted this value without proper validation, CAPTCHA protections can be bypassed, enabling automated login attempts and significantly increasing the risk of account takeover (ATO). This issue is fixed in version 2.0.14.",
