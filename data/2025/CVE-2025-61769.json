    "description": "Emlog is an open source website building system. A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in emlog up to and including version 2.5.22 allows authenticated remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the file upload functionality. As an authenticated user it is possible to upload .svg file that contains JavaScript code that is later being executed. Commit 052f9c4226b2c0014bcd857fec47677340b185b1 fixes the issue.",
