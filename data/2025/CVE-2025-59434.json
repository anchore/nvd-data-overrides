    "description": "Flowise is a drag & drop user interface to build a customized large language model flow. Prior to August 2025 Cloud-Hosted Flowise, an authenticated vulnerability in Flowise Cloud allows any user on the free tier to access sensitive environment variables from other tenants via the Custom JavaScript Function node. This includes secrets such as OpenAI API keys, AWS credentials, Supabase tokens, and Google Cloud secrets â€” resulting in a full cross-tenant data exposure. This issue has been patched in the August 2025 Cloud-Hosted Flowise.",
