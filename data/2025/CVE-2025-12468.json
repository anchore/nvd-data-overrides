    "description": "The FunnelKit Automations – Email Marketing Automation and CRM for WordPress & WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.4.1 via the '/wc-coupons/' REST API endpoint. This is due to the endpoint being marked as a public API (`public_api = true`), which results in the endpoint being registered with `permission_callback => '__return_true'`, bypassing all authentication and capability checks. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data including all WooCommerce coupon codes, coupon IDs, and expiration status.",
