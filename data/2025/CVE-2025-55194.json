    "description": "Part-DB is an open source inventory management system for electronic components. Prior to version 1.17.3, any authenticated user can upload a profile picture with a misleading file extension (e.g., .jpg.txt), resulting in a persistent 500 Internal Server Error when attempting to view or edit that userâ€™s profile. This makes the profile permanently inaccessible via the UI for both users and administrators, constituting a Denial of Service (DoS) within the user management interface. This issue has been patched in version 1.17.3.",
