    "description": "A bypass of the DISALLOWED_SQL_FUNCTIONS security feature in Apache Superset allows for the execution of blocked SQL functions. An attacker can use a special inline block to circumvent the denylist. This allows a user with SQL Lab access to execute functions that were intended to be disabled, leading to the disclosure of sensitive database information like the software version.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Superset: before 5.0.0.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 5.0.0, which fixes the issue.",
