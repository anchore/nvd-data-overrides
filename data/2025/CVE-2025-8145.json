    "description": "The Redirection for Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.4 via deserialization of untrusted input in the get_lead_fields function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. The additional presence of a POP chain in a Contact Form 7 plugin allows attackers to delete arbitrary files. Additionally, in certain server configurations, Remote Code Execution is possible",
