    "description": "Outline is a service that allows for collaborative documentation. In versions 0.72.0 through 0.83.0, Outline introduced a feature which facilitates local file system storage capabilities as an optional file storage strategy. This feature allowed a CSP bypass as well as a ContentType bypass that might facilitate further attacks. In the case of self-hosting and using Outline FILE_STORAGE=local on the same domain as the Outline application, a malicious payload can be uploaded as a file attachment and bypass those CSP restrictions, allowing script execution within the context of another user. This is fixed in version 0.84.0.",
