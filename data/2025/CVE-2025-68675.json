    "description": "In Apache Airflow versions before 3.1.6, the proxies and proxy fields within a Connection may include proxy URLs containing embedded authentication information. These fields were not treated as sensitive by default and therefore were not automatically masked in log output. As a result, when such connections are rendered or printed to logs, proxy credentials embedded in these fields could be exposed.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to 3.1.6 or later, which fixes this issue",
