    "description": "The Echo RSS Feed Post Generator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the echo_generate_featured_image() function in all versions up to, and including, 5.4.8.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.",
