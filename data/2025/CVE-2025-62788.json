    "description": "Wazuh is a free and open source platform used for threat prevention, detection, and response. Prior to 4.11.0, w_copy_event_for_log() references memory (initially allocated in OS_CleanMSG()) after it has been freed. A compromised agent can potentially compromise the integrity of the application by sending a specially crafted message to the wazuh manager. An attacker who is able to craft and send an agent message to the wazuh manager can leverage this issue to potentially compromise the integrity of the application (the use of previously freed memory may corrupt valid data, if the memory area in question has been allocated and used properly elsewhere). This vulnerability is fixed in 4.11.0.",
