    "description": "Indico is an event management system that uses Flask-Multipass, a multi-backend authentication system for Flask. Prior to version 3.3.8, a legacy API to retrieve user details could be misused to retrieve profile details of other users without having admin permissions due to a broken access check. Users should to update to Indico 3.3.8 as soon as possible. As a workaround, it is possible to restrict access to the affected API (e.g. in the webserver config).",
