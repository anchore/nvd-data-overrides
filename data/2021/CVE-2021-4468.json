    "description": "PLANEX CS-QP50F-ING2 smart cameras expose a configuration backup interface over HTTP that does not require authentication. A remote, unauthenticated attacker can directly retrieve a compressed configuration backup file from the device. The backup contains sensitive configuration information, including credentials, allowing an attacker to obtain administrative access to the camera and compromise the confidentiality of the monitored environment.",
