    "description": "The Bricks theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.8.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'save_settings' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the theme's settings, including enabling a setting which allows lower-privileged users such as contributors to perform code execution, via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
