    "description": "A remote PHP code execution vulnerability exists in InstantCMS version 1.6 and earlier due to unsafe use of eval() within the search view handler. Specifically, user-supplied input passed via the look parameter is concatenated into a PHP expression and executed without proper sanitation. A remote attacker can exploit this flaw by sending a crafted HTTP GET request with a base64-encoded payload in the Cmd header, resulting in arbitrary PHP code execution within the context of the web server.",
