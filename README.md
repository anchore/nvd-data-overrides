# Grype DB NVD Overrides

This repository is for filling the gap NVD has left in the Grype vulnerability dataset. On Feb 15, 2024 [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov) stopped their regular process of enriching most CVE IDs with additional metadata. This data was used by Grype to match artifacts not covered by other ecosystems.

This repo is meant to provide additional data that is currently missing from NVD, and ensure Grype can use that enrichment.

Please note, this data does not provide severity information. By definition only NVD can supply NVD CVSS scores.

# Future vulnerability data effort

The tooling that drives this repo as well as ideas for capturing the vulnerability data in a nicer way is being tracked in a repo called [vulnerability-data-tools](https://github.com/anchore/vulnerability-data-tools). Please use that repo for future ideas.

We have a Google Document that describes some ideas and concepts for a later vulnerability enrichment project. This particular repository is a short term stopgap to quickly deal with the missing NVD enrichment. Long term we would like to provide vulnerability enrichment in a much more sustainable way. The data in this repository will be included in the future efforts, so the work is not wasted effort.

We have a lot of ideas on how to do this better in the future. We envision a data format capable of generating the data currently stored in this repository. The NVD format is very constrained. By capturing the same data but formatting it in a nicer way, it will be possible to output any format needed. NVD, OSV, cve5, and more. Think of this repository as a place to learn what we don't know yet.

Regardless of the data format used, it can be expected that this override data will be generated and available for the forseeable future.

# FAQ

### What happens if NVD goes back to normal?
In the event NVD returns, or some other project takes over the current task of NVD, we expect to continue to maintain this project. Grype needs the ability to augment and enrich some of the vulnerability data. Not every vulnerability database supports every ecosystem.

For example there could be vulnerability data about a binary they build, but if that binary is also downloaded from the project directly, that information may not be tracked anywhere else.

### Isn't PURL better than CPE? Why don't you just use PURL
The intent of this repo is to mimic the data NVD provided. There are many tools that expect data in the same format as NVD.

Other data formats, such as OSV, can support PURL. One of our goals is to store metadata in a way that different formats can be the output of the project.

### Is this meant to replace CVE?
Not at all. The purpose is to enrich only existing vulnerability identifiers. Every current vulnerability identification project has a constrained scope. This is meant to fill some of the gaps left by those constraints.

### Shouldn't this project be part of some larger foundation?
Probably yes. However, the best way to create a successful open source project is to do the work. Finding a long term home for this effort will come once we have proven assumptions and have a functioning process.

### How can I help?
You're welcome to submit PRs to this repo as well as the [vulnerability-data-tools](https://github.com/anchore/vulnerability-data-tools) repo. There is also a Slack channel in the Anchore Community Slack called [#vulnerability-data-project](https://anchorecommunity.slack.com/archives/C06Q9UTQD2L).
