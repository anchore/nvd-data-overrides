# Grype DB NVD Overrides

This repository is for filling the gap NVD has left in the Grype vulnerability dataset. On Feb 15, 2024 [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov) stopped their regular process of enriching most CVE IDs with additional metadata. This data was used by Grype to match artifacts not covered by other ecosystems.

This repo is meant to provide additional data that is currently missing from NVD, and ensure Grype can use that enrichment.

Please note, this data does not provide severity information. By definition only NVD can supply NVD CVSS scores.

# Future vulnerability data effort

The tooling that drives this repo as well as ideas for capturing the vulnerability data in a nicer way is being tracked in a repo called [vulnerability-data-tools](https://github.com/anchore/vulnerability-data-tools). Please use that repo for future ideas.

We have a Google Document that describes some ideas and concepts for a later vulnerability enrichment project. This particular repository is a short term stopgap to quickly deal with the missing NVD enrichment. Long term we would like to provide vulnerability enrichment in a much more sustainable way. The data in this repository will be included in the future efforts, so the work is not wasted effort.
